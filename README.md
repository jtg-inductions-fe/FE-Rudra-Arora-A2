## React Base Template

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20+. You can download and install it from nodejs.org.
- **yarn**: Version 4.5.0. If Yarn is not installed, you can follow the instruction below in Installing section

### Installing

To set up the project on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, you need to clone the repository.

2. **nvm (Node Version Manager)**: If the required Node version 20+ is already installed and active, you can skip this step else you can use nvm (Node Version Manager). Here's how to use it:

    - **Switch Node Version**: If the required Node version is already installed, run:

    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```

    - **Install Node Version**: If the required Node version isnâ€™t installed, you can install it by running:

    ```bash
    nvm install
    ```

    > **_Tip:_** If you don't have nvm installed, you can install it by following the instructions on [nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

    Alternatively, you can update Node.js directly by downloading the latest version from the official website: nodejs.org.

    - **Yarn Installation**: If Yarn is not installed, you can install it globally with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    ```

    - **Switch to correct version**: Switch to yarn latest version

    ```bash
    yarn set version berry
    ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies using yarn**

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

    > **_NOTE_** : It is recommended to update all packages to their latest versions by running `yarn upgrade --latest`. If the updated packages introduce breaking changes, you may need to adjust the base template accordingly.

4. **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    The app will typically be available at http://localhost:3000, but check the terminal output for the exact URL.

    > **_NOTE:_** : If you want to change the server's port number, you can do so by creating a **.env file** at the root level of the project and update the PORT field (check **.env.template** for reference)

    ```env
    PORT=<New Port>
    ```

5. **Format the Code**

    ```bash
    yarn prettier
    ```

6. **Lint the Code**

    ```bash
    yarn lint
    ```

7. **To Fix Lint errors**

    ```bash
    yarn lint:fix
    ```

8. **Build the Project**

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    This command will generate the optimized production build in the dist directory.

9. **Development Build**

    ```bash
    yarn build:dev
    ```

    This command will generate the build for development environment in the dist directory

10. **Preview the build**

    ```bash
    yarn preview
    ```

11. **Setup Husky (If pre-commit hooks are not working)**

    ```bash
    yarn postinstall
    ```
